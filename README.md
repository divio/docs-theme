# Divio Documentation Theme

This project is based on the [furo](https://github.com/pradyunsg/furo) theme.

## Installation

Make sure you have a **virtual environment activated**:

- `nvm use 14`
- `npm install`
- `pip install nox`
- `git submodule update --init`

## Usage

Make sure you have a **virtual environment activated**:

- `nox -s docs-live` to start the local development server
- `nox -s lint` to run linting

Furo is distributed on [PyPI]. To use the theme in your Sphinx project:

1. Install Furo in documentation's build environment.

   ```text
   pip install furo
   ```

2. Update the `html_theme` in `conf.py`.

   ```py
   html_theme = "furo"
   ```

3. Your Sphinx documentation's HTML pages will now be generated with this theme! ðŸŽ‰

## What's with the name?

I plucked this from the scientific name for [Domesticated Ferrets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferret): Mustela putorius **furo**.

A ferret is actually a really good spirit animal for this project: cute, small, steals little things from various places, and hisses at you when you try to make it do things it doesn't like.

> I plan on commissioning a logo for this project (or making one myself) consisting of a cute ferret. Please reach out if you're interested!
